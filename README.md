# Fish Friends API

## About

Author: Marla Foreman

This will eventually be a web application that will allow you to check whether a group of saltwater fish are compatible or not, for the purposes of starting a saltwater aquarium.  For now, it is an in-progress API.

The data used for fish compatibility can be found on this website: https://www.ocellarisclownfish.com/compatibility/.

## Tech Used

* .NET framework
* NUnit
* PostgreSQL
* ReactJS (for the site, coming soon)
